  Bayesian statistics uses probability distributions as the inference engine of
  the parameter and uncertainty estimates.

  #v(2em)

  Imagine that probability distributions are small "Lego" pieces. We can construct
  anything we want with these little pieces. We can make a castle, a house, a
  city; literally anything.

  The same is valid for Bayesian statistical models. We can construct models from
  the simplest ones to the most complex using probability distributions and their
  relationships.

#slide(
  title: [Probability Distribution Function],
)[
  A probability distribution function is a mathematical function that outputs the
  probabilities for different results of an experiment. It is a mathematical
  description of a random phenomena in terms of its sample space and the event
  probabilities (subsets of the sample space).

  $ P(X): X → RR ∈ [0, 1] $

  For discrete random variables, we define as "mass", and for continuous random
  variables, we define as "density".
]

#slide(
  title: [Mathematical Notation],
)[
  We use the notation
  $ X tilde "Dist"(θ_1, θ_2, dots) $

  where:

  - $X$: random variable

  - Dist: distribution name

  - $θ_1, θ_2, dots$: parameters that define how the distribution behaves

  Every probability distribution can be "parameterized" by specifying parameters
  that allow to control certain distribution aspects for a specific goal.

  In discrete probability distributions we call the probability of a distribution
  taking certain values as "mass". The probability mass function (PMF) is the
  function that specifies the probability of a random variable $X$ taking value $x$:

  Bernoulli distribution describes a binary event of the success of an experiment.
  We represent $0$ as failure and $1$ as success, hence the result of a Bernoulli
  distribution is a binary variable $Y ∈ {0, 1}$.

  Bernoulli distribution is often used to model binary discrete results where
  there is only two possible results.

  Bernoulli distribution has only a single parameter and its notation is
  $"Bernoulli"(p)$:

  Poisson distribution has one parameter and its notation is $"Poisson"(λ)$:

    values in an interval $[a,b]$.

  This assumption is due to the central limit theorem (CLT) that, under precise

  finite mean and variance is itself a random variable which the underlying
  distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples
  increases (as $n → oo$).

  The log-normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random
  variable which its natural logarithm is distributed as a normal distribution.
  Thus, if the natural logarithm a random variable $X$, $ln(X)$, is distributed as
  a normal distribution, then $Y = ln(X)$ is normally distributed and
  $X$ is log-normally distributed.

  A log-normal random variable only takes positive real values. It is a convenient
  and useful model for measurements in exact and engineering sciences, as well as
  in biomedical, economical and other sciences. For example, energy,
  concentrations, length, financial returns and other measurements.

  A log-normal process is the statistical realization of a multiplicative product
  of many independent positive random variables.

    Student's $t$ distribution arises by estimating the mean of a
    normally-distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and
    the standard deviation is known #footnote[this is where the ubiquitous Student's $t$ test.].

    #v(1em)

    If we take a sample of $n$ observations from a normal distribution, then
    Student's $t$ distribution with $ν = n - 1$ degrees of freedom can be defined as
    the distribution of the location of the sample mean in relation to the true
    mean, divided by the sample's standard deviation, after multiplying by the
    scaling term $sqrt(n)$.

    #v(1em)

    Student's $t$ distribution is symmetric and in a bell-shape, like the normal
    distribution, but with long tails, which means that has more chance to produce
    values far away from its mean.
